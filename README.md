# 💡 Fonij Startup Ideas
```
☀️ Act as if what you do makes a difference. It does.
```
Thank you for watching this repository! 😊

This repo showcases a collection of my **startup web app demos**. Each idea features a **GitHub Pages** demo, built using frontend code originally generated by [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/), then refactored and customized by [Me](https://github.com/Fonij80).


## Demo Apps

| Logo | App Name | Live Demo | Description |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| ![App #1 Logo](apps/web-apps/universa/universa-logo.png) | **Universa** | [View Demo](https://fonij80.github.io/universa-client/) | Find Your Perfect Academic Journey |
| ![App #2 Logo](apps/web-apps/wizzylist/logo.png) | **WizzyList** | [View Demo](https://your-username.github.io/app-two-demo) | Your Magical Wishlist |




> **Tip:** To add a new idea, simply add your logo file to `apps/[web-apps/mobile-apps]/[your-app-name]/[your-app-name].png` and add a row in the table above.  
> *Recommended logo size: 64x64 px.*

## How It Works

- **Frontend Source:** Generated by [lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/), then refactored with React + Vite.
- **Live Demo:** Each app is deployed to GitHub Pages for instant access and feedback.
- **Customization:** Features and code are improved and fine-tuned for startup use.

## Adding a New App

1. **Create a folder:**
   - For Web Apps: Add a new directory under `/apps/web-apps/[your-app-name]/`.
   - For Mobile Apps: Add a new directory under `/apps/mobile-apps/[your-app-name]/`.
3. **Add your logo:** Place a `[your-app-name]-logo.png` file inside that directory.
4. **Update README:** Add a new entry in the table above with your app’s:
    - Logo (local path: `apps/[web-apps/mobile-apps]/[your-app-name]/[your-app-name].png`)
    - Name (bold)
    - Live demo link (GitHub Pages URL)
    - Short description
